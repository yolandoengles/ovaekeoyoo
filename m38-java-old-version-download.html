Still plugging away, 10 years later. 7 years ago, that Java bug got fixed. 5 years ago, that CGI instruction was depreciated. 3 years ago RC4 encryption no longer supported Now, you’re tasked with managing a device that you can’t login to!

The scenario is that some attackers could hack my site, and change the innocent version of the tool I provide by a seemingly identical tool that also send your credential somewhere it shouldn't be sent to.

Hello! I play minecraft java on windows 10/Mac, but wanted to get into Minecraft VR. First off, Ive seen this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWwtjMPd8SY but its a couple years old and might be outdated. My first question I guess, is do I have to download another version of Minecraft like a VR version to play it from my windows 10 computer? also, can I use say an oculus go for something like that? I'm confused on how this all works version wise and which headsets do what, because 
I run a support program. I am very happy with firefox, but it keeps updating making it incompatible with my java based apps. I can't update Firefox until they update the apps. Firefox updates anyway. amp#x200B; So far I have modified all settings in firefox to not update. I have blocked mozilla.org/.net/.com (https://mozilla.org/.net/.com) in the firewall. I have blocked just about everything in the firewall I can find that even remotely connects to mozilla. I have set the registry. The archiving of _public_ Google+ content to the Internet Archive (https://web.archive.org/) by the ArchiveTeam (https://www.archiveteam.org/) has has begun. What does this mean, how does this affect you, and what can you do?

Ive been playing the new version of the game for the first time in a few years, and I'm just noticing all the music I've come to know and love is gone. what gives?? Should I just pay the old version, java or what ever it is? Is there mods that add the music back? I really dont like this new version of MC they made me download. 
This is a slightly complex issue to explain so bear with me! Last month I was using Skype when it logged me out without warning. When I went to log in again it didn't recognise my password and I was unable to use the recovery tools to get in. It was an old account not connected to an email address (that I can remember) so I got confused but moved on. I tried setting up a new account as a test, using a disposable email address, and the same thing happened. I wasn't able to recover So, yeah. Title. #Installation Instructions Right click this link (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nuclearfarts/OldCombat_simple/master/1.14-oldcombat.json) and press "Save Link As" (or something similar, it depends on your browser.) Navigate to your minecraft folder (this depends on your OS). Open the folder called "versions" and make a folder in there called "1.14-oldcombat". Put the file into the folder (make sure the file is called "1.14-oldcombat.json"). Open the Minecraft launcher. This isn't a question, but a more or less ready project you might like as well. First of all, here's an Example Video (https://drive.google.com/open?id=13ajW9diBzorTeQs71OAmkMfgt8jTkYAZ). Looks interesting? Then here's a bit of text to read ;) amp#x200B; Recently I got the update to Android P and with it the new app prediction system in the app overview. Unfortunately this only works with the Stock Launcher and not with the Nova Launcher, which I prefer to use. Furthermore this featur. Hello, let me explain what java means to me first, Java is the thing usually required for very old or stupid software pops up from a stupid source. For example one of the government cloud services requiring java and especially a very old version and we need to install java to access that. Or, some function of some commercial software requires java to run. Or we need java to access on old hardware. I don't know what SE or JRE or JDK means.

In an attempt to get LAN working between my newer MBP and my old desktop I deleted Minecraft and tired to install the new Java edition. To which I receive the message: You can't use this version of the application Minecraft with this version of Mac OS X. Requires 10.8 or later. I am unable to update this computer.
